# Project Overview
In this capstone project, a Data Scientist newly hired by an AI-powered weather data analytics company is tasked with analyzing how weather affects bike-sharing demand in urban areas. The project involves collecting data from various sources, performing data wrangling and exploratory analysis using tools like SQL, Tidyverse, and ggplot2, and building predictive models with Tidymodels. Additionally, an interactive dashboard will be created using R Shiny to visualize the data and predictions.The project concludes with a comprehensive report and a presentation aimed at providing actionable insights for optimizing bike-sharing systems based on weather patterns

# Data Source
Rental bikes are available in many cities around the globe. It is important for each of these cities to provide a reliable supply of rental bikes to optimize availablity and accessibility to the public at all times. Also important is minimizing the cost of these programs, in part by minimizing the number of bikes supplied in order to meet the demand. Thus, to help optimize the supply it would be helpful to be able to predict the number of bikes required each hour of the day, based on currrent conditions such as the weather.The Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set was designed for this purpose. It contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), and the number of bikes rented per hour and date.

You will use this dataset to build a linear regression model of the number of bikes rented each hour, based on the weather.
